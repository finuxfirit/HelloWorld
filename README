# HelloWorld C++ 

This here is a basic C++ app that I created from scratch and will be my HelloWorld app for this language.

## Plans

I plan to update this as I progress throughout learning C++.

### Current Features

Here are some the cool things this app can do:

* Remember a line of text you tell it
* Ask you questions
* Oh. It can do some math. 

### Installation

No installation needed. There is a 'helloworld.exe' file in the directory. Just click that. Here is a step by step:

```
$ Open folder
$ Click 'helloworld.exe' 
$ Profit?
```

## Usage

Use it anyway you want

```
$ A silly Hello World program for your class
$ A door stop
$ A fun tool
```

## Deployment

Nah. None
